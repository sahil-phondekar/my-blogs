We will use the installer media now to install Ubuntu.\\r\\n\\r\\nConnect the USB drive / pen-drive to the PC and power ON the PC (Note: If you are already logged in to Windows simply connect the pen-drive to PC and restart your PC)\\r\\n\\r\\nWhile the PC is starting press F12 continuously to open the boot menu (The keys to access boot menu varies according to brand, F12 is boot menu key for Dell and Lenovo, F10 for HP) \\r\\n\\r\\n![Boot Menu](./boot-menu.png)\\r\\n\\r\\nOnce on the boot menu screen you can select your USB device from the list of available boot devices.\\r\\n\\r\\nAfter selecting your USB device press Enter to boot into Ubuntu. If a grub screen as shown in following figure appears select Try Ubuntu without installing\\r\\n\\r\\n![Try Ubuntu](./try-ubuntu.png)\\r\\n\\r\\nIt will take some time to boot into the OS after which the following screen will appear. You can click on Try Ubuntu to get the feel of the OS before actually installing it or you can directly proceed to install the OS by clicking Install Ubuntu.\\r\\n\\r\\n![Install Ubuntu](./install-ubuntu.png)\\r\\n\\r\\nAfter clicking on Install Ubuntu the following screen will open. Select your keyboard layout and click on Continue.\\r\\n\\r\\n![Keyboard Layout](./keyboard-layout.png)\\r\\n\\r\\nIn the next screen you will need to select the apps to install while installing Ubuntu.\\r\\n\\r\\nFor Normal Installation it will install all softwares for web browsers, utilities, office softwares, games and media players. \\r\\n\\r\\nSelect Minimal Installation if you do not need more software or are short in space. ( Note: You can install these softwares later if  required )\\r\\n\\r\\nHere we will proceed with Normal Installation\\r\\n\\r\\nUn-check Other Options i.e Download updates while installing Ubuntu and Install third-party software and click on Continue\\r\\n\\r\\n![Install](./install.png)\\r\\n\\r\\nNext you need to select the Installation type\\r\\n\\r\\nSelect Something else from the available options and click Continue. This gives us the freedom to make our own partitions and allocate space as per our needs.\\r\\n\\r\\n![Installation Type](./installation-type.png)\\r\\n\\r\\nThe next window we need to create partitions for our installation.\\r\\n\\r\\nFrom the available partitions select the free space partition. Its nearly 50 GB of free space. \\r\\n\\r\\nWe will be creating two partitions from the available 50 GB space: \\r\\n\\r\\n- The root (/) partition (same as C: Drive in windows)\\r\\n- The swap partition (Its like an extra RAM, its a partition that works as a RAM when the original RAM memory is fully utilised. The recommended swap memory size ~ 2 * RAM size)\\r\\n\\r\\nYou can also add the Home partition (as D: and E: drives in Windows) to properly organise your system files. But I will skip that here.\\r\\n\\r\\n![Installation Type 1](./installation-type-1.png)\\r\\n\\r\\nOnce you have selected the free space partition click on the plus ( + ) icon on the window. This will open a Create Partition window.\\r\\n\\r\\nWe will first create the root partition.\\r\\n\\r\\nEnter the size of the partition as 40000 MB, select the type as Logical and location as Beginning of this space.  Use as : Ext4 journaling file system\\r\\n\\r\\nSelect the mount point as (/) i.e root and click on OK. This will create the root partition.\\r\\n\\r\\n![Create Partition](./create-partition.png)\\r\\n\\r\\nNext we will add the swap partition. \\r\\n\\r\\nSelect the available free space partition and click on plus ( + ) icon. This will again open the Create Partition window.  \\r\\n\\r\\nEnter the size of the partition as 8000 MB, select the type as Logical and location as Beginning of this space.  Select Use as : swap area and click OK. \\r\\n\\r\\n![Create Partition](./create-partition-2.png)\\r\\n\\r\\nHence we are done with creating the root and swap partition. Now you can click Install Now\\r\\n\\r\\n![Something else](./something-else.png)\\r\\n\\r\\nA confirmation window will pop up. Click on Continue to proceed with the installation. \\r\\n\\r\\n![Something else](./something-else-2.png)\\r\\n\\r\\nBefore starting the installation you need to enter some details..\\r\\n\\r\\nSelect your time zone and click Continue\\r\\n\\r\\n![Time Zone](./time-zone.png)\\r\\n\\r\\nEnter your login details and click on Continue\\r\\n\\r\\n![Login Details](./login-details.png)\\r\\n\\r\\nNow your installation will begin. This will take some time.\\r\\n\\r\\n![Installation](./installation.png)\\r\\n\\r\\nOnce the installation is complete you can restart the computer by clicking Restart Now\\r\\n\\r\\n![Restart](./restart.png)\\r\\n\\r\\nAfter restarting your computer you will now see a grub screen from where you can choose between the two OS. Select Ubuntu to boot into Ubuntu OS and select Windows Boot Manager to boot into Windows 10.\\r\\n\\r\\n![Grub Screen](./grub-screen.png)\\r\\n\\r\\nThis completes the installation of Ubuntu alongside Windows 10.\ud83d\ude0e"},{"id":"dual-boot-ubuntu-p1","metadata":{"permalink":"/blog/dual-boot-ubuntu-p1","source":"@site/blog/2020-08-08-dual-boot-ubuntu-p1/index.md","title":"Dual Boot Ubuntu Alongside Windows 10 - Part 1","description":"Dual Boot or VMware?","date":"2020-08-08T00:00:00.000Z","tags":[{"inline":false,"label":"Linux","permalink":"/blog/tags/linux","description":"Linux Operating System"},{"inline":false,"label":"Ubuntu","permalink":"/blog/tags/ubuntu","description":"Ubuntu Operating System"},{"inline":false,"label":"Windows 10","permalink":"/blog/tags/windows10","description":"Windows 10 Operating System"}],"readingTime":3.325,"hasTruncateMarker":true,"authors":[{"name":"Sahil Phondekar","title":"Sr. Software Engineer @Everestek","url":"https://github.com/sahil-phondekar","page":{"permalink":"/blog/authors/sahil"},"socials":{"linkedin":"https://www.linkedin.com/in/sahil-phondekar/","x":"https://x.com/sahilphondekar","github":"https://github.com/sahil-phondekar"},"imageURL":"https://github.com/sahil-phondekar.png","key":"sahil"}],"frontMatter":{"slug":"dual-boot-ubuntu-p1","title":"Dual Boot Ubuntu Alongside Windows 10 - Part 1","authors":["sahil"],"tags":["linux","ubuntu","windows10"]},"unlisted":false,"prevItem":{"title":"Dual Boot Ubuntu Alongside Windows 10 - Part 2","permalink":"/blog/dual-boot-ubuntu-p2"},"nextItem":{"title":"Ubuntu (Linux) - My OS for programming","permalink":"/blog/ubuntu"}},"content":"### Dual Boot or VMware?\\r\\n\\r\\nDepending on the work or requirements of a particular assigned task, one may require a specific operating system or a specific version of an operating system (eg. Linux or Windows 7 or Windows 10).\\r\\n\x3c!-- truncate --\x3e\\r\\n\\r\\nTo install multiple copies of different OS on a machine there are two ways: Dual Boot or use a VMware software.\\r\\n\\r\\n### Why use Dual Boot?\\r\\n\\r\\nIn case of dual boot the system hardware is completely dedicated to the particular OS. \\r\\n\\r\\nSimply consider your PC has a 4 GB of RAM and 1 TB of Hard disk space. In case of dual boot the the OS you are running will be able to use full available RAM improving high performance tasks experience.\\r\\n\\r\\nIn Virtual Machine Software you use one OS on top of another, thus dividing the available RAM among these two OS. \\r\\n\\r\\nIt is preferable to use dual boot, if your system lacks high speed hardwares and you are to be working on the selected OS for a longer duration.\\r\\n\\r\\nIn case you just need to use the OS for a small work or quick tasks, VMware is recommended.\\r\\n\\r\\n### Dual Boot Ubuntu alongside Windows 10\\r\\n\\r\\n#### Step 1 : Create a partition for Ubuntu OS\\r\\n\\r\\nTo install Ubuntu on your computer you need to set aside some free space on the hard disk. The recommended system requirements for Ubuntu 20.04 LTS are: \\r\\n\\r\\n- 2 GHz dual core processor or better\\r\\n- 4 GB RAM\\r\\n- 25 GB of free hard drive space\\r\\n\\r\\nIn most windows PC the hard disk is majorly partitioned into \\r\\n\\r\\n- OS (C:) drive -  Windows system and OS files are installed here\\r\\n- D: drive, E: drive ,etc - Mainly for personal storage purpose (Optional)\\r\\n\\r\\nIn this step we have to create such one partition to install the Ubuntu OS and to store its system files\\r\\n\\r\\n- Login to your windows system and open Disk Management     \\r\\n![Disk Management Window](./disk-management-window.png)\\r\\n- In above window there is a OS (C:) partition which is of 223.50 GB of disk space ( sizes will vary according to system ). Ubuntu requires minimum 25 GB of free disk space. Here I will use 50 GB of the available space for the OS installation.\\r\\n- Right Click on the OS (C:) drive partition and select Shrink Volume.      \\r\\n![Shrink Volume](./shrink-vomume.png)\\r\\n- After clicking Shrink Volume the following window will open      \\r\\n![Shrink C](./shrink-c.png)\\r\\n- In the input for column Enter the amount of space to shrink in MB enter 50000 and then click on Shrink button. \\r\\n- Once done you will be able to see a Unallocated 50 GB partition which we will be using to install Ubuntu.      \\r\\n![Unallocated Partition](./unallocated-partition.png)\\r\\n\\r\\n#### Step 2 : Creating an Installer Media\\r\\n\\r\\nBefore proceeding further make sure you have downloaded the following softwares and have the necessary hardware ( USB drive / Pendrive - minimum 8 GB )\\r\\n\\r\\n1. Ubuntu .iso Image File ([Download](https://ubuntu.com/download/desktop))\\r\\n2. SD Memory Card Formatter Software ([Download](https://www.sdcard.org/downloads/formatter/eula_windows/index.html))\\r\\n3. Balena Etcher Software ([Download](https://www.balena.io/etcher/))\\r\\n\\r\\nOnce you have all the necessaries, you can connect the pendrive to the windows PC.\\r\\n\\r\\n**A. Formatting the USB Drive**\\r\\n\\r\\nLaunch the SDFormatter application, once you have downloaded and installed the SD formatter from given download link. The following window will open.      \\r\\n![SD Formatter v4](./sd-formatter.png)\\r\\n\\r\\nClick on Option and select FORMAT TYPE as FULL (Erase) and then select OK   \\r\\n![Option Setting](./option-setting.png)\\r\\n\\r\\nNow click on Format.

At the time of writing this post the latest version was version 1.8.5.\\r\\n\\r\\n\x3c!-- truncate --\x3e\\r\\n\\r\\nI have downloaded the Windows Zip file for non-admin install.   \\r\\n![Download Arduino](./download-arduino.jpg)\\r\\n\\r\\nOnce downloaded, extract the file and you will find the Arduino software in there, no need of any installing procedures.   \\r\\n![File Explorer](./file-explorer.jpg)\\r\\n\\r\\nIf you are connecting your Arduino Board for the first time you will require to install the necessary drivers to make the board compatible .\\r\\n\\r\\nThe drivers are available in the drivers folder in the extracted folder.\\r\\n\\r\\nJust open it and find the **Arduino.inf** file in it. Copy the path of the drivers folder.   \\r\\n![Drivers](./drivers.jpg)\\r\\n\\r\\nNow open the Device Manager   \\r\\n![Device Manager](./device-manager.jpg)\\r\\n\\r\\nIn the device manager, when you connect the Arduino you will find your device name in the Ports(COM & LPT). For eg. Arduino UNO or Arduino MEGA etc. If you cant find your device under Ports(COM & LPT) look under Other Devices.\\r\\n\\r\\nOnce you have found your device, Right click on the device and select Update Driver Software.   \\r\\n![Device Manager](./device-manager-2.jpg)\\r\\n\\r\\nThe following window will open   \\r\\n![Update Driver](./update-driver.jpg)\\r\\n\\r\\nSelect Browse my computer for driver software and browse to the drivers folder or paste the address of the driver software and click Next.   \\r\\n![Update Driver 2](./update-driver-2.jpg)\\r\\n\\r\\nAfter this the windows will install the necessary driver and you are ready to go. Connect your device and simply plug and play."}]}}')}}]);
