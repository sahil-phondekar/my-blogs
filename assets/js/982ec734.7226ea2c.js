This type of SSO flow is initiated by the Identity Provider (IdP) and does not require an initial authentication request from the Service Provider (SP). Instead, the IdP generates a **SAML Response** and directly redirects the user to the SP.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n## Step 1: Create a Private and Public RSA Key\\r\\n### Why Do You Need RSA Keys?\\r\\nSAML responses must be **digitally signed** to ensure their authenticity and integrity. To do this, you need a **private key** for signing the SAML assertion and a **public key** for verification by the Service Provider.\\r\\n\\r\\n### How to Generate RSA Keys Using OpenSSL\\r\\n1. **Generate a Private Key:**\\r\\n   ```bash\\r\\n   openssl genrsa -out private-key.pem 3072\\r\\n   ```\\r\\n2. **Generate the Corresponding Public Key:**\\r\\n   ```bash\\r\\n   openssl rsa -in private-key.pem -pubout -out public-key.pem\\r\\n   ```\\r\\n3. **Generate an X.509 Certificate (Optional, but recommended):**\\r\\n   ```bash\\r\\n   openssl req -new -x509 -key private_key.pem -out certificate.pem -days 365\\r\\n   ```\\r\\n   This certificate is used to verify the signature of the SAML response.\\r\\n\\r\\nNow you have:\\r\\n- **Private Key (private_key.pem)** \u2013 Used to sign the SAML response.\\r\\n- **Public Key (public_key.pem)** \u2013 Shared with the SP for verification.\\r\\n- **Certificate (certificate.pem)** \u2013 Used by the SP to validate signatures.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n## Step 2: Get the Required SAML Metadata\\r\\nBefore generating the SAML response, you need the necessary metadata from both the IdP and SP. The key details include:\\r\\n\\r\\n### Identity Provider (IdP) Information\\r\\n- **IdP Entity ID**: The unique identifier for the IdP.\\r\\n- **Single Sign-On (SSO) URL**: The URL where the IdP sends the SAML response.\\r\\n\\r\\n### Service Provider (SP) Information\\r\\n- **SP Entity ID**: The unique identifier for the SP.\\r\\n- **SP Assertion Consumer Service (ACS) URL**: The URL where the SAML response should be sent.\\r\\n- **Target URL**: The URL where users will be redirected after authentication.\\r\\n- **Destination of the Response**: The expected destination in the SAML response.\\r\\n\\r\\nExample of metadata retrieval:\\r\\n- If using **MockSAML**, the SP metadata can be found at:  \\r\\n[https://mocksaml.com/api/saml/metadata](https://mocksaml.com/api/saml/metadata)\\r\\n\\r\\nThis metadata provides the necessary details to construct the SAML response.\\r\\n\\r\\n## Step 3: Share the Public Key with the SP\\r\\nBefore the SP can validate SAML responses from the IdP, it needs access to the **public key or certificate** that was used to sign the responses.\\r\\n\\r\\n### How to Share the Public Key\\r\\n1. **Provide the public key (public_key.pem) to the SP** manually or through a metadata file.\\r\\n2. **Use an X.509 certificate (certificate.pem)** to make validation easier.\\r\\n3. **If the SP supports metadata exchange**, provide an XML metadata file that includes the public key:\\r\\n   \\r\\n   ```xml\\r\\n   <md:EntityDescriptor xmlns:md=\\"urn:oasis:names:tc:SAML:2.0:metadata\\" entityID=\\"https://idp.example.com\\">\\r\\n       <md:IDPSSODescriptor protocolSupportEnumeration=\\"urn:oasis:names:tc:SAML:2.0:protocol\\">\\r\\n           <md:KeyDescriptor use=\\"signing\\">\\r\\n               <ds:KeyInfo xmlns:ds=\\"http://www.w3.org/2000/09/xmldsig#\\">\\r\\n                   <ds:X509Data>\\r\\n                       <ds:X509Certificate>MIIC4jCCAc...</ds:X509Certificate>\\r\\n                   </ds:X509Data>\\r\\n               </ds:KeyInfo>\\r\\n           </md:KeyDescriptor>\\r\\n       </md:IDPSSODescriptor>\\r\\n   </md:EntityDescriptor>\\r\\n   ```\\r\\nThe SP will use this key to validate signatures on the SAML responses.\\r\\n\\r\\n## Step 4: Generate the SAML Response\\r\\nOnce you have the metadata, it\'s time to generate the **SAML Response**.\\r\\n\\r\\n### Structure of a SAML Response\\r\\nA valid **SAML Response** consists of:\\r\\n1. **Issuer** \u2013 The IdP Entity ID.\\r\\n2. **Assertion** \u2013 Contains authentication details, subject information, and attributes.\\r\\n3. **Signature** \u2013 Ensures the response integrity.\\r\\n\\r\\n### **Example SAML Response (Before Signing)**\\r\\n```xml\\r\\n<samlp:Response xmlns:samlp=\\"urn:oasis:names:tc:SAML:2.0:protocol\\" \\r\\n    Destination=\\"https://sp.example.com/sso\\" \\r\\n    ID=\\"_12345\\" \\r\\n    InResponseTo=\\"\\" \\r\\n    IssueInstant=\\"2025-04-01T12:34:56Z\\" \\r\\n    Version=\\"2.0\\">\\r\\n    \\r\\n    <saml:Issuer xmlns:saml=\\"urn:oasis:names:tc:SAML:2.0:assertion\\">\\r\\n        https://idp.example.com\\r\\n    </saml:Issuer>\\r\\n\\r\\n    <saml:Assertion xmlns:saml=\\"urn:oasis:names:tc:SAML:2.0:assertion\\" ID=\\"_67890\\">\\r\\n        <saml:Subject>\\r\\n            <saml:NameID Format=\\"urn:oasis:names:tc:SAML:1.1:nameid-format:emailAddress\\">\\r\\n                user@example.com\\r\\n            </saml:NameID>\\r\\n        </saml:Subject>\\r\\n    </saml:Assertion>\\r\\n\\r\\n</samlp:Response>\\r\\n```\\r\\n\\r\\n## Step 5: Sign the SAML Response\\r\\nTo ensure the SAML response is trusted, it must be signed using the **private key**.\\r\\n\\r\\n### Signing the Response in Node.js\\r\\n```javascript\\r\\nimport { SignedXml } from \\"xml-crypto\\";\\r\\n\\r\\nconst sig = new SignedXml();\\r\\nsig.signingKey = privateKey;\\r\\nsig.addReference(\\"//*[local-name(.)=\'Assertion\']\\");\\r\\nsig.computeSignature(samlResponse);\\r\\n\\r\\nconst signedSAML = sig.getSignedXml();\\r\\n```\\r\\n\\r\\nNow your **SAML Response is signed** and ready to be sent.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n## Step 6: Send SAML Response Using HTTP POST Binding\\r\\nOnce the SAML response is generated and signed, it needs to be sent to the **SP Assertion Consumer Service (ACS) URL** via an **HTTP POST request**.\\r\\n\\r\\n### Example HTML Form for Posting SAML Response\\r\\n```html\\r\\n<form method=\\"POST\\" action=\\"https://sp.example.com/sso\\">\\r\\n    <input type=\\"hidden\\" name=\\"SAMLResponse\\" value=\\"BASE64_ENCODED_SAML\\">\\r\\n    <input type=\\"submit\\" value=\\"Login\\">\\r\\n</form>\\r\\n<script>\\r\\n    document.forms[0].submit();\\r\\n<\/script>\\r\\n```\\r\\nThis form automatically **redirects the user** to the SP with the SAML response.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n## Conclusion\\r\\nBy following these steps, you can successfully implement **IdP-initiated SSO using SAML**. Here\u2019s a recap:\\r\\n1. **Generate RSA Keys** \u2013 Create private and public keys for signing SAML responses.\\r\\n2. **Retrieve Metadata** \u2013 Get Entity IDs, ACS URL, and other details from IdP and SP.\\r\\n3. **Share the Public Key with the SP** \u2013 Ensure the SP can verify your signed SAML responses.\\r\\n4. **Generate SAML Response** \u2013 Construct the XML structure with authentication details.\\r\\n5. **Sign the Response** \u2013 Use OpenSSL or xml-crypto to sign the response.\\r\\n6. **Send via HTTP POST** \u2013 Encode and transmit the response to the SP ACS URL.\\r\\n\\r\\nBy using tools like **OpenSSL, SAML Tracer, and SAMLTool.com**, you can debug and validate your SAML integration efficiently."},{"id":"sso-saml-tools","metadata":{"permalink":"/my-blogs/blog/sso-saml-tools","source":"@site/blog/2023-04-30-sso-saml/index.md","title":"Tools I Use for Generating & Testing Valid SAML Responses","description":"In today\'s world of web applications, security and seamless user authentication are paramount.

In this post, I will share the essential tools I use to develop, generate, and test valid SAML responses, as well as improve the overall development process.\\r\\n\\r\\n## 1. OpenSSL for Windows\\r\\n\\r\\n### What is OpenSSL?\\r\\n\\r\\n**OpenSSL** is a comprehensive toolkit that implements SSL and TLS protocols. It also provides a robust suite of cryptographic functions, including the ability to generate public and private keys for encryption and digital signing. These keys are crucial for the signing and verification of SAML assertions.\\r\\n\\r\\n### Why Do I Use OpenSSL?\\r\\nFor developing SSO applications, you need to generate keys (private and public) to sign and verify SAML assertions. OpenSSL allows you to generate these keys securely and manage their lifecycle.\\r\\n\\r\\n### How OpenSSL Helps:\\r\\n- **Private key generation**: You can use OpenSSL to generate a private key that will sign your SAML assertions.\\r\\n- **Public key generation**: From the private key, you can derive the corresponding public key, which will be shared with your Service Provider (SP) for verification purposes.\\r\\n  \\r\\n### How to Get It:\\r\\nTo install OpenSSL on Windows, you can use the Win32/Win64 OpenSSL Installer from the official website. This installer comes with precompiled binaries, making it easy to get up and running without worrying about manual compilation.\\r\\n\\r\\nYou can download it from here: [Win32 OpenSSL](https://slproweb.com/products/Win32OpenSSL.html)\\r\\n\\r\\n---\\r\\n\\r\\n## 2. Generating RSA Keys with OpenSSL\\r\\n\\r\\n### What are RSA Keys?\\r\\n**RSA** (Rivest-Shamir-Adleman) is an asymmetric encryption algorithm widely used for securing sensitive data, particularly in digital signatures. In the context of SSO, RSA keys are used to sign and verify SAML assertions.\\r\\n\\r\\n### Why Use RSA Keys for SSO?\\r\\nSAML relies on digital signatures to ensure the authenticity of authentication data. The **private key** is used to sign the SAML assertions, while the **public key** is used by the Service Provider to verify the authenticity of the assertions.\\r\\n\\r\\n### Generating RSA Keys:\\r\\nHere is where Scott Brady\'s guide comes in. His blog provides an easy-to-follow guide on how to generate RSA keys using OpenSSL.\\r\\n\\r\\n- **Step 1**: Generate the RSA private key.\\r\\n    ```\\r\\n    openssl genrsa -out private-key.pem 3072\\r\\n    ```\\r\\n- **Step 2**: Derive the corresponding public key from the private key.\\r\\n    ```\\r\\n    openssl rsa -in private-key.pem -pubout -out public-key.pem\\r\\n    ```\\r\\nHaving both the public and private keys is essential for generating and verifying SAML assertions.\\r\\n\\r\\nYou can check out the guide here: [Creating RSA Keys with OpenSSL](https://www.scottbrady.io/openssl/creating-rsa-keys-using-openssl)\\r\\n\\r\\n---\\r\\n\\r\\n## 3. SAML Tracer Chrome Extension\\r\\n\\r\\n### What is SAML Tracer?\\r\\nThe **SAML Tracer** is a Chrome extension that allows you to intercept and view SAML messages exchanged between your browser and the identity or service provider.   \\r\\n\\r\\n![samltracer](./saml-tracer.png)\\r\\n\\r\\n### Why is SAML Tracer Useful?\\r\\nSAML messages are typically passed in the background between the browser and the SSO infrastructure. As a developer, it\u2019s important to inspect these messages to ensure that everything is functioning correctly. The SAML Tracer enables you to:\\r\\n- Capture SAML requests and responses.\\r\\n- View the SAML assertions that are sent to and received from the IdP.\\r\\n- Debug issues with the authentication flow by inspecting the raw SAML messages.\\r\\n\\r\\nWith real-time analysis, you can verify that your SSO setup is working as intended, making this tool indispensable for SAML debugging.\\r\\n\\r\\nYou can download it from the Chrome Web Store: [SAML Tracer](https://chromewebstore.google.com/detail/mpdajninpobndbfcldcmbpnnbhibjmch?utm_source=item-share-cb)\\r\\n\\r\\n---\\r\\n\\r\\n## 4. SAMLTool.com\\r\\n\\r\\n### What is SAMLTool.com?\\r\\n[SAMLTool.com](https://www.samltool.com/) is an online suite of tools for working with SAML messages. It provides a variety of utilities to help developers manage, test, and troubleshoot SAML assertions and responses.\\r\\n\\r\\n### Key Features:\\r\\n- **Decode and Encode SAML**: You can decode base64-encoded SAML assertions and encode them back for testing.\\r\\n- **Sign and Validate SAML**: It provides tools to digitally sign and validate SAML assertions using your keys.\\r\\n- **Generate Metadata**: SAMLTool can help generate and validate SAML metadata for both IdPs and SPs.\\r\\n- **Encryption and Decryption**: It also allows for the encryption and decryption of SAML messages, ensuring that sensitive data remains secure during transit.\\r\\n\\r\\nThis tool is highly useful for:\\r\\n- Testing the structure of your SAML assertions.\\r\\n- Validating if the assertions are correctly signed and encrypted.\\r\\n- Quickly debugging issues in SSO integrations.\\r\\n\\r\\nYou can visit SAMLTool here: [SAMLTool.com](https://www.samltool.com/)\\r\\n\\r\\n---\\r\\n\\r\\n## Conclusion\\r\\n\\r\\nBuilding secure and efficient Single Sign-On (SSO) systems using SAML requires the use of specialized tools. Whether you are generating RSA keys for signing assertions, inspecting SAML requests and responses, or validating your SAML responses, these tools will ensure that your SSO application works smoothly.\\r\\n\\r\\n- **OpenSSL** for generating and managing keys.\\r\\n- **Scott Brady\'s Guide** for creating RSA keys using OpenSSL.\\r\\n- **SAML Tracer** Chrome extension for intercepting and inspecting SAML messages.\\r\\n- **SAMLTool.com** for testing and validating SAML responses.\\r\\n\\r\\nIncorporating these tools into your development process can significantly streamline the creation, testing, and validation of SSO applications.

The steps involved are:\\r\\n1. The user tries to access a protected resource on the SP.\\r\\n2. The SP generates a **SAML Authentication Request** and redirects the user to the IdP.\\r\\n3. The IdP authenticates the user and generates a **SAML Response**.\\r\\n4. The IdP redirects the user back to the SP with the SAML Response.\\r\\n5. The SP validates the response and grants access.\\r\\n\\r\\n**Advantages of SP-Initiated Login:**\\r\\n- The SP has control over when authentication should happen.\\r\\n- Helps prevent unauthorized access since authentication requests are always initiated by the SP.\\r\\n\\r\\n**Challenges:**\\r\\n- Requires additional setup and configurations on both IdP and SP.\\r\\n- More steps compared to IdP-Initiated login, potentially causing delays.\\r\\n\\r\\n![sp](./idp-initated.png)\\r\\n\\r\\n## Which SSO Technique Should You Choose?\\r\\n\\r\\nChoosing between IdP-Initiated and SP-Initiated login depends on your use case:\\r\\n- **If you need centralized authentication and access to multiple applications from a portal, use IdP-Initiated Login.**\\r\\n- **If security and access control are crucial, and authentication should always start at the SP, use SP-Initiated Login.**\\r\\n\\r\\n## Final Thoughts\\r\\n\\r\\nBoth IdP-Initiated and SP-Initiated logins have their own advantages and limitations. Organizations should evaluate their security requirements and user experience needs when deciding which approach to implement. With proper implementation, SAML SSO enhances security, reduces login fatigue, and improves user productivity.\\r\\n\\r\\n## Reference\\r\\nThis blog post is based on information from [miniOrange](https://www.miniorange.com/blog/idp-initiated-sp-initiated-login/)"},{"id":"sso-saml-basics","metadata":{"permalink":"/my-blogs/blog/sso-saml-basics","source":"@site/blog/2023-04-28-sso-saml/index.md","title":"Understanding SSO and SAML - A Beginner\'s Guide","description":"In today\u2019s digital world, managing multiple usernames and passwords for different applications can be frustrating.

Stripe offers a **Payment Element**, a prebuilt UI component that simplifies checkout by supporting multiple payment methods in a single integration. In this blog, we\u2019ll walk through integrating Stripe\u2019s Payment Element with a **React frontend** and a **Spring Boot backend**, ensuring a smooth and secure payment experience.  \\r\\n\\r\\n---  \\r\\n\x3c!-- truncate --\x3e\\r\\n\\r\\n## Why Use Stripe\'s Payment Element?\\r\\n\\r\\nThe **Payment Element** is a powerful tool that provides:  \\r\\n\\r\\n**Multiple payment method support** \u2013 Accepts credit cards, Apple Pay, Google Pay, and local payment methods.  \\r\\n**Prebuilt UI** \u2013 Designed to be user-friendly and easy to integrate.  \\r\\n**Automatic updates** \u2013 Ensures compliance with the latest security and payment regulations.  \\r\\n**Dynamic behavior** \u2013 Adjusts based on the user\'s location and preferred payment options.  \\r\\n\\r\\nWhether you are building an **e-commerce store, subscription service, or digital marketplace**, Stripe\u2019s Payment Element simplifies the entire payment process.  \\r\\n\\r\\n---  \\r\\n\\r\\n## Prerequisites for Integration  \\r\\n\\r\\nBefore integrating Stripe, ensure you have:  \\r\\n\\r\\n- A **Stripe account** \u2013 You can sign up at [Stripe](https://stripe.com/).  \\r\\n- A **React frontend** \u2013 To display the payment form and handle user interactions.  \\r\\n- A **Spring Boot backend** \u2013 To communicate securely with Stripe\u2019s API.  \\r\\n- A **Stripe API key** \u2013 Found in your Stripe dashboard, which enables backend communication with Stripe.  \\r\\n\\r\\n---  \\r\\n\\r\\n## Step 1: Setting Up Stripe in Your React Application\\r\\n\\r\\nTo begin, install the required Stripe packages in your React app. The frontend will use Stripe\u2019s **Elements provider**, which wraps your checkout form and provides the necessary Stripe context.  \\r\\n\\r\\nThe **Payment Element** dynamically loads different payment methods based on the user\u2019s location and previously used payment options, making the checkout experience seamless.  \\r\\n\\r\\n---  \\r\\n\\r\\n## Step 2: Setting Up the Backend with Spring Boot  \\r\\n\\r\\nYour **Spring Boot backend** is responsible for securely handling payment requests. It will:  \\r\\n\\r\\n1. **Generate a PaymentIntent** \u2013 This step involves communicating with Stripe\u2019s API to create a payment session. The backend will return a `clientSecret`, which the frontend will use to initialize the Payment Element.  \\r\\n2. **Store transaction details** \u2013 Keeping a record of payments ensures that you can track transactions, issue refunds, and manage disputes.  \\r\\n3. **Handle webhooks (optional but recommended)** \u2013 Webhooks allow your application to listen for events such as **successful payments, failed transactions, or refunds**. This improves reliability by ensuring that payments are processed correctly even if the user closes their browser before seeing the confirmation page.  \\r\\n\\r\\n---  \\r\\n\\r\\n## Step 3: Integrating the Payment Element in React\\r\\n\\r\\nOnce the backend is ready, the frontend will:  \\r\\n\\r\\n1. **Request a client secret** from the backend when a user initiates a payment.  \\r\\n2. **Display the Payment Element** in a secure, responsive payment form.  \\r\\n3. **Handle form submission and confirmation** \u2013 Once the user submits their payment, Stripe processes the transaction and redirects them to a success or failure page.  \\r\\n\\r\\nStripe handles most of the heavy lifting, including validating payment details, processing the transaction, and securely handling sensitive data.  \\r\\n\\r\\n---  \\r\\n\\r\\n## Step 4: Confirming the Payment\\r\\n\\r\\nOnce a payment is submitted, Stripe takes over. Depending on the payment method, the user may need to complete additional authentication steps, such as **3D Secure** for card payments.  \\r\\n\\r\\nAfter the payment is processed, Stripe will:  \\r\\n\\r\\n**Redirect the user** to a success page if the payment is completed.  \\r\\n**Display an error message** if there are issues with the payment (e.g., insufficient funds, incorrect card details).  \\r\\n**Trigger a webhook event** (if enabled) to notify your backend about the payment status.  \\r\\n\\r\\nWebhooks are essential for ensuring that even if a user closes their browser or loses internet connection, your application can still confirm whether the payment was successful.  \\r\\n\\r\\n---  \\r\\n\\r\\n## Step 5: Testing with Stripe\u2019s Test Mode\\r\\n\\r\\nBefore going live, use **Stripe\u2019s test mode** to simulate transactions. Stripe provides test card numbers that allow you to check different payment scenarios, such as successful payments, declined transactions, and authentication challenges.  \\r\\n\\r\\nThis ensures that your integration is working correctly before you process real payments.  \\r\\n\\r\\n---  \\r\\n\\r\\n## Final Thoughts  \\r\\n\\r\\nIntegrating **Stripe\u2019s Payment Element** with a **React frontend** and **Spring Boot backend** simplifies the entire payment process, making it **secure, reliable, and user-friendly**. Whether you\u2019re building a one-time payment system or handling recurring subscriptions, Stripe provides a **scalable** and **efficient** solution.  \\r\\n\\r\\n### What\u2019s Next?  \\r\\n\\r\\n**Customization** \u2013 Modify the Payment Element UI to match your brand.  \\r\\n**Additional Payment Methods** \u2013 Enable support for **Apple Pay, Google Pay, and local payment options**.  \\r\\n**Recurring Payments & Subscriptions** \u2013 Implement Stripe Billing for automatic renewals.  \\r\\n**Webhooks & Notifications** \u2013 Set up webhooks to track payment statuses and automate order processing.  \\r\\n\\r\\nTo learn more, check out **[Stripe\u2019s official documentation](https://stripe.com/docs/payments/payment-element)** and start building a seamless checkout experience today!"},{"id":"dual-boot-ubuntu-p2","metadata":{"permalink":"/my-blogs/blog/dual-boot-ubuntu-p2","source":"@site/blog/2020-08-09-dual-boot-ubuntu-p2/index.md","title":"Dual Boot Ubuntu Alongside Windows 10 - Part 2","description":"We have completed the following steps in the previous blog Dual Boot Ubuntu Alongside Windows 10 - Part 1","date":"2020-08-09T00:00:00.000Z","tags":[{"inline":false,"label":"Linux","permalink":"/my-blogs/blog/tags/linux","description":"Linux Operating System"},{"inline":false,"label":"Ubuntu","permalink":"/my-blogs/blog/tags/ubuntu","description":"Ubuntu Operating System"},{"inline":false,"label":"Windows 10","permalink":"/my-blogs/blog/tags/windows10","description":"Windows 10 Operating System"}],"readingTime":3.945,"hasTruncateMarker":true,"authors":[{"name":"Sahil Phondekar","title":"Sr. Software Engineer @Everestek","url":"https://github.com/sahil-phondekar","page":{"permalink":"/my-blogs/blog/authors/sahil"},"socials":{"linkedin":"https://www.linkedin.com/in/sahil-phondekar/","x":"https://x.com/sahilphondekar","github":"https://github.com/sahil-phondekar"},"imageURL":"https://github.com/sahil-phondekar.png","key":"sahil"}],"frontMatter":{"slug":"dual-boot-ubuntu-p2","title":"Dual Boot Ubuntu Alongside Windows 10 - Part 2","authors":["sahil"],"tags":["linux","ubuntu","windows10"]},"unlisted":false,"prevItem":{"title":"Stripe Payment Element in React & Spring Boot","permalink":"/my-blogs/blog/stripe-react"},"nextItem":{"title":"Dual Boot Ubuntu Alongside Windows 10 - Part 1","permalink":"/my-blogs/blog/dual-boot-ubuntu-p1"}},"content":"We have completed the following steps in the previous blog [Dual Boot Ubuntu Alongside Windows 10 - Part 1](/blog/dual-boot-ubuntu-p1)\\r\\n\\r\\n***Step 1 : Create a partition for Ubuntu OS***    \\r\\n***Step 2 : Creating an Installer Media***\\r\\n\\r\\nNow we will proceed with the installation of Ubuntu in the next step...\\r\\n\\r\\n\x3c!-- truncate --\x3e\\r\\n\\r\\n#### Step 3 : Installing Ubuntu with Dual boot on Windows 10\\r\\n\\r\\nIn the last steps we have created an installer media using the USB drive. We will use the installer media now to install Ubuntu.\\r\\n\\r\\nConnect the USB drive / pen-drive to the PC and power ON the PC (Note: If you are already logged in to Windows simply connect the pen-drive to PC and restart your PC)\\r\\n\\r\\nWhile the PC is starting press F12 continuously to open the boot menu (The keys to access boot menu varies according to brand, F12 is boot menu key for Dell and Lenovo, F10 for HP) \\r\\n\\r\\n![Boot Menu](./boot-menu.png)\\r\\n\\r\\nOnce on the boot menu screen you can select your USB device from the list of available boot devices.\\r\\n\\r\\nAfter selecting your USB device press Enter to boot into Ubuntu. If a grub screen as shown in following figure appears select Try Ubuntu without installing\\r\\n\\r\\n![Try Ubuntu](./try-ubuntu.png)\\r\\n\\r\\nIt will take some time to boot into the OS after which the following screen will appear. You can click on Try Ubuntu to get the feel of the OS before actually installing it or you can directly proceed to install the OS by clicking Install Ubuntu.\\r\\n\\r\\n![Install Ubuntu](./install-ubuntu.png)\\r\\n\\r\\nAfter clicking on Install Ubuntu the following screen will open. Select your keyboard layout and click on Continue.\\r\\n\\r\\n![Keyboard Layout](./keyboard-layout.png)\\r\\n\\r\\nIn the next screen you will need to select the apps to install while installing Ubuntu.\\r\\n\\r\\nFor Normal Installation it will install all softwares for web browsers, utilities, office softwares, games and media players. \\r\\n\\r\\nSelect Minimal Installation if you do not need more software or are short in space. ( Note: You can install these softwares later if  required )\\r\\n\\r\\nHere we will proceed with Normal Installation\\r\\n\\r\\nUn-check Other Options i.e Download updates while installing Ubuntu and Install third-party software and click on Continue\\r\\n\\r\\n![Install](./install.png)\\r\\n\\r\\nNext you need to select the Installation type\\r\\n\\r\\nSelect Something else from the available options and click Continue. This gives us the freedom to make our own partitions and allocate space as per our needs.\\r\\n\\r\\n![Installation Type](./installation-type.png)\\r\\n\\r\\nThe next window we need to create partitions for our installation.\\r\\n\\r\\nFrom the available partitions select the free space partition. Its nearly 50 GB of free space. \\r\\n\\r\\nWe will be creating two partitions from the available 50 GB space: \\r\\n\\r\\n- The root (/) partition (same as C: Drive in windows)\\r\\n- The swap partition (Its like an extra RAM, its a partition that works as a RAM when the original RAM memory is fully utilised. The recommended swap memory size ~ 2 * RAM size)\\r\\n\\r\\nYou can also add the Home partition (as D: and E: drives in Windows) to properly organise your system files. But I will skip that here.\\r\\n\\r\\n![Installation Type 1](./installation-type-1.png)\\r\\n\\r\\nOnce you have selected the free space partition click on the plus ( + ) icon on the window. This will open a Create Partition window.\\r\\n\\r\\nWe will first create the root partition.\\r\\n\\r\\nEnter the size of the partition as 40000 MB, select the type as Logical and location as Beginning of this space.  Use as : Ext4 journaling file system\\r\\n\\r\\nSelect the mount point as (/) i.e root and click on OK. This will create the root partition.\\r\\n\\r\\n![Create Partition](./create-partition.png)\\r\\n\\r\\nNext we will add the swap partition. \\r\\n\\r\\nSelect the available free space partition and click on plus ( + ) icon. This will again open the Create Partition window.  \\r\\n\\r\\nEnter the size of the partition as 8000 MB, select the type as Logical and location as Beginning of this space.  Select Use as : swap area and click OK. \\r\\n\\r\\n![Create Partition](./create-partition-2.png)\\r\\n\\r\\nHence we are done with creating the root and swap partition. Now you can click Install Now\\r\\n\\r\\n![Something else](./something-else.png)\\r\\n\\r\\nA confirmation window will pop up. Click on Continue to proceed with the installation. \\r\\n\\r\\n![Something else](./something-else-2.png)\\r\\n\\r\\nBefore starting the installation you need to enter some details..\\r\\n\\r\\nSelect your time zone and click Continue\\r\\n\\r\\n![Time Zone](./time-zone.png)\\r\\n\\r\\nEnter your login details and click on Continue\\r\\n\\r\\n![Login Details](./login-details.png)\\r\\n\\r\\nNow your installation will begin.

In case of dual boot the the OS you are running will be able to use full available RAM improving high performance tasks experience.\\r\\n\\r\\nIn Virtual Machine Software you use one OS on top of another, thus dividing the available RAM among these two OS. \\r\\n\\r\\nIt is preferable to use dual boot, if your system lacks high speed hardwares and you are to be working on the selected OS for a longer duration.\\r\\n\\r\\nIn case you just need to use the OS for a small work or quick tasks, VMware is recommended.\\r\\n\\r\\n### Dual Boot Ubuntu alongside Windows 10\\r\\n\\r\\n#### Step 1 : Create a partition for Ubuntu OS\\r\\n\\r\\nTo install Ubuntu on your computer you need to set aside some free space on the hard disk. The recommended system requirements for Ubuntu 20.04 LTS are: \\r\\n\\r\\n- 2 GHz dual core processor or better\\r\\n- 4 GB RAM\\r\\n- 25 GB of free hard drive space\\r\\n\\r\\nIn most windows PC the hard disk is majorly partitioned into \\r\\n\\r\\n- OS (C:) drive -  Windows system and OS files are installed here\\r\\n- D: drive, E: drive ,etc - Mainly for personal storage purpose (Optional)\\r\\n\\r\\nIn this step we have to create such one partition to install the Ubuntu OS and to store its system files\\r\\n\\r\\n- Login to your windows system and open Disk Management     \\r\\n![Disk Management Window](./disk-management-window.png)\\r\\n- In above window there is a OS (C:) partition which is of 223.50 GB of disk space ( sizes will vary according to system ). Ubuntu requires minimum 25 GB of free disk space. Here I will use 50 GB of the available space for the OS installation.\\r\\n- Right Click on the OS (C:) drive partition and select Shrink Volume.      \\r\\n![Shrink Volume](./shrink-vomume.png)\\r\\n- After clicking Shrink Volume the following window will open      \\r\\n![Shrink C](./shrink-c.png)\\r\\n- In the input for column Enter the amount of space to shrink in MB enter 50000 and then click on Shrink button. \\r\\n- Once done you will be able to see a Unallocated 50 GB partition which we will be using to install Ubuntu.      \\r\\n![Unallocated Partition](./unallocated-partition.png)\\r\\n\\r\\n#### Step 2 : Creating an Installer Media\\r\\n\\r\\nBefore proceeding further make sure you have downloaded the following softwares and have the necessary hardware ( USB drive / Pendrive - minimum 8 GB )\\r\\n\\r\\n1. Ubuntu .iso Image File ([Download](https://ubuntu.com/download/desktop))\\r\\n2.

Since then it has became immensely popular as a low cost computer.\\r\\n\\r\\nThere are many models of the Raspberry Pi from Raspberry Pi zero to Raspberry Pi 3. \\r\\n\\r\\nIn this blog I will more concentrate on the latest raspberry pi model RASPBERRY PI 3, Model B which comes with 1 GB RAM.\\r\\n\\r\\n\x3c!-- truncate --\x3e\\r\\n\\r\\n#### Materials Required:\\r\\n\\r\\n1. A Raspberry Pi 3, Model B.\\r\\n2. A minimum 8 GB SD Card. I am using a 16 GB SD Card.\\r\\n3. A micro USB cable for powering the Pi.\\r\\n4. A LAN cable.\\r\\n5. Softwares Required\\r\\n    -   SDFormatter\\r\\n    -   Win32 disc Manager software\\r\\n    -   Xming\\r\\n    -   Putty\\r\\n\\r\\n#### Steps:\\r\\n\\r\\nWe are going to install our OS on the SD card, so definitely we will require it to be fully empty. So the first step is to format the SD card.\\r\\n\\r\\nFor this purpose you can use the application SDFormatter. You can download it from https://www.sdcard.org/downloads/formatter/\\r\\n\\r\\nOnce done with this install it on your PC. Just  go with the flow, Next -Next and INSTALL.\\r\\n\\r\\n#### Now follow these steps to get your SD card ready.\\r\\n\\r\\n1. Connect the SD card to your PC.   \\r\\n2. Now open the SDFormatter software. It will look as shown in the following screenshot.   \\r\\n![SD Formatter](./sdformatter.jpg)   \\r\\n3. Make sure your SD Card drive name is selected. If not you can do this now.   \\r\\n4. Now click on option. A pop up window will open as seen in the next screenshot.   \\r\\n![SD Formatter](./sdformatter-2.jpg)   \\r\\n5. Select format type as FULL(erase) and format size adjustment as OFF.   \\r\\n6. Now click OK and select format. This will prepare our SD Card for OS installation \\r\\n\\r\\n#### Now its time to write the OS to our SD Card.\\r\\n\\r\\nNow you will require the **Disc Image File Raspbian-jessie** which you can get from https://downloads.raspberrypi.org/raspbian/images/\\r\\n\\r\\nOnce you have downloaded and extracted the .img file, place it in a proper folder for now so that it is easy to browse to it.   \\r\\n![File Explorer](./file-explorer.jpg)\\r\\n\\r\\nNow you are ready to install this image file onto your SD Card. For this you will require the **win32 disc Manager software**. You can download from https://win32diskimager.org/.\\r\\n\\r\\nOnce installed open the software. It will look as in following screenshot    \\r\\n![Disk Imager](./disk-imager.jpg)\\r\\n\\r\\nFrom the Browse options go to the location of the Raspbian image file. In my case it is F:\\\\Raspberry Pi OS.   \\r\\n![Raspbian Image](./raspbian-image.png)\\r\\n\\r\\nOnce you select the .img file click open.   \\r\\n![Disk Imager 2](./disk-imager-2.png)\\r\\n\\r\\nNow click on Write and  this will start the writing the OS on the SD Card. Once it is done click on OK.\\r\\n\\r\\nNow browse to the SD Card from your PC\'s File Browser and open it.   \\r\\n![File Explorer](./file-explorer-2.png)\\r\\n\\r\\nNow find the file CMDline.txt file. And open it in Notepad.      \\r\\n![Notepad](./notepad.png)\\r\\n\\r\\nIn this file find the word `rootwait` and replace it by `rootwait ip=169.254.211.247`.    \\r\\n![Notepad 2](./notepad-2.png)\\r\\n\\r\\nNow connect the SD Card to Raspberry Pi. \\r\\n\\r\\nIn the next post we will see how to install the setup the Raspberry Pi with our PC."},{"id":"setting-arduino-software","metadata":{"permalink":"/my-blogs/blog/setting-arduino-software","source":"@site/blog/2018-01-07-setting-arduino-software/index.md","title":"Setting Up Arduino Software for the First time","description":"Setup for Arduino IDE:","date":"2018-01-07T00:00:00.000Z","tags":[{"inline":false,"label":"Arduino","permalink":"/my-blogs/blog/tags/arduino","description":"Arduino IDE"},{"inline":false,"label":"Windows 10","permalink":"/my-blogs/blog/tags/windows10","description":"Windows 10 Operating System"}],"readingTime":1.275,"hasTruncateMarker":true,"authors":[{"name":"Sahil Phondekar","title":"Sr. Software Engineer @Everestek","url":"https://github.com/sahil-phondekar","page":{"permalink":"/my-blogs/blog/authors/sahil"},"socials":{"linkedin":"https://www.linkedin.com/in/sahil-phondekar/","x":"https://x.com/sahilphondekar","github":"https://github.com/sahil-phondekar"},"imageURL":"https://github.com/sahil-phondekar.png","key":"sahil"}],"frontMatter":{"slug":"setting-arduino-software","title":"Setting Up Arduino Software for the First time","authors":["sahil"],"tags":["arduino","windows10"]},"unlisted":false,"prevItem":{"title":"Setting Up Raspberry Pi 3 - Part 1","permalink":"/my-blogs/blog/setting-raspberry-pi-software-p1"}},"content":"### Setup for Arduino IDE:\\r\\n\\r\\n#### Installing the Software:\\r\\n\\r\\nYou can download the Arduino IDE from the official site of Arduino https://www.arduino.cc/en/Main/Software.
