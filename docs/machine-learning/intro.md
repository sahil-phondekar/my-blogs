# Introduction

Machine learning (ML) is a subset of artificial intelligence (AI) that focuses on building systems that can learn from data, improve over time, and make predictions or decisions without being explicitly programmed for each specific task.

## The Machine Learning Process

This process has 3 main steps:

### 1. Data Pre-Processing

- Import the data
- Clean the data
- Split into training and test sets
- Feature Scaling

### 2. Modelling

- Build the model
- Train the model
- Make predictions

### 3. Evaluation
- Calculate performance metrices
- Make a verdict
