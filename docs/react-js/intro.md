# Introduction

## What is react?

- React is a JavaScript library used to build user interfaces (UIs), especially for single-page applications.

- It's developed and maintained by Facebook.

- React helps you create reusable UI components, making your app more efficient and easier to manage.

## Why use React?

1. Component-based architecture:
    - React breaks the UI into smaller, reusable pieces called components.
    - These components can be easily shared, tested, and maintained.

2. Declarative UI:

    - Instead of worrying about how to change the UI, React lets you focus on what the UI should look like for any given state.
    - React will handle the UI updates for you when the state of your application changes.

3. Virtual DOM:

    - React uses a Virtual DOM (a lightweight copy of the actual DOM).
    - When a component's state changes, React first updates the Virtual DOM, then compares it to the real DOM, and only updates the parts that have actually changed. This makes updates faster and more efficient.

4. Unidirectional Data Flow:
    - Data in React flows in one direction: from parent components to child components.
    - This helps keep your app predictable and easier to debug.
