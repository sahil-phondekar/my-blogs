# Introduction to Flutter  

## What is Flutter?  
Flutter is an open-source framework created by Google for building mobile, web, and desktop applications using a **single codebase**. This means you don’t need to write separate code for Android, iOS, or other platforms.  

### Key Features:  
✅ Uses **Dart** programming language.  
✅ Provides a **fast development** experience with **hot reload** (see changes instantly).  
✅ Offers **beautiful UI widgets** for a smooth and native-like experience.  

## What is Dart?  
Dart is the programming language used in Flutter. It is:  
- Developed by **Google**.  
- **Easy to learn** (similar to JavaScript & Java).  
- **Fast** because it compiles to native machine code.  
- Used for both **frontend (UI)** and **backend (server-side with Dart VM)**.  

**Example of Dart Code:**  
```dart
void main() {
  print('Hello, Flutter!');
}
```  
This prints **"Hello, Flutter!"** to the console.  

## One Codebase, Multiple Platforms  
With Flutter, you write **one set of code**, and it runs on:  
📱 **Android & iOS**  
💻 **Windows, macOS, Linux**  
🌐 **Web (Chrome, Edge, etc.)**  
📺 **Embedded Devices**  

Instead of learning **Swift (iOS)** and **Kotlin (Android)** separately, Flutter lets you build apps for both using Dart!  

## Setup Flutter  
Follow the official documentation for step-by-step setup:  
👉 [Flutter Installation Guide](https://flutter.dev/docs/get-started/install)  

## Creating Fluter App

To create a new Flutter app, use the following command in your terminal or command prompt:  

```sh
flutter create my_app
```

Replace `my_app` with your desired project name.  

### Steps to Run the App:  
1. Navigate into your project folder:  
   ```sh
   cd my_app
   ```
2. Run the app on a connected device or emulator:  
   ```sh
   flutter run
   ```
