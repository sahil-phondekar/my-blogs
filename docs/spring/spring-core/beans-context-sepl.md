# Introduction to Spring Beans, Context, SpEL

- Any normal Java class that is instantiated, assembled, and otherwise managed by a Spring loC container is called Spring Bean.

- These beans are created with the configuration metadata that you supply to the container either in the form of XML configs and Annotations. 

- Spring loC Container manages the lifecycle of Spring Bean scope and injecting any required dependencies in the bean. 

- Context is like a memory location of your app in which we add all the object instances that we want the framework to manage. By default, Spring doesnâ€™t know any of the objects you define in your application. To enable Spring to see your objects, you need to add them to the context. 

- The SpEL (Sprint Expression Language) provides a powerful expression language for querying and manipulating an object graph at runtime like setting and getting property values, property assignment, method invocation etc.
